 Reference Types
In Java, a string class is considered a reference type.

 

Write a Java program to cipher and decipher a message. Cipher is a system of writing that prevents unintended targets (users) from understanding a message.

 

Create a class "CipherDecipher" and write two methods public String ciphering(String normal) (logic for ciphering), and public String deciphering(String ciphered) (logic for deciphering). 

 

To cipher a message:

 

Swap the case of the string- UpperCase to LowerCase letters, and vice-versa.
Reverse the string using StringBuilder.
Replace the spacing between characters in the string with * (star).
Replace the characters in even positions with their corresponding ASCII value.
Append any integer to the string.
 

The final string is the ciphered message.

 

To decipher the message, do the above steps in reverse order.

 

Input:

 

The first line contains the string to cipher.
The second line contains the string to cipher.
 

Output:

 

The first line contains the ciphered text of the first input.
The second line contains the ciphered text of the second input.
 

Note: Before ciphering, ensure that the text does not contain numbers.
